			%c[guide_blue]Blind dogs%c[default] are the most familiar representative of the Zone.\n
			\n%c[guide_green]Information%c[default]
			\nSeveral generations of dogs have lived and died since the second disaster, with each being more affected by the Zone than the previous.\n
			\nNumerous rapid mutations and evolutionary adaptations have led to the strengthening of previously weakly expressed canine abilities - at the expense of those that share their habitat.\n
			\nVision and hearing in many of these dogs is completely lost, but they have since developed a kind of telepathic vision that allows them to feel their prey through the walls.\n
			\nLike their wolf ancestors, blind dogs hunt in packs, and an encounter with a large group can be dangerous even to the most well-armed and experienced of stalkers.\n

			%c[guide_blue]Bloodsuckers%c[default], as the name would suggest, are hematophagous monsters.\n
			\n%c[guide_green]Information%c[default]
			\nThe bloodsucker is a semi-legendary creature, often seen by stalkers as a symbol of both the dangers and corruption of the Zone.\n
			\nThis status has been achieved thanks to the species' relative rarity and the low survival rate of its victims.\n
			\nThose who have encountered them and lived to tell about it have described them as looking like tall slouching humanoids with many tentacles protruding from their faces.\n
			\nPerhaps their most peculiar ability is their optic camouflage, which allows them to temporarily become almost invisible to the naked eye.\n
			\nTypically this won't last long, as they are at their weakest when cloaked and will often only use it when discovering prey or trying to hide their movements.\n

			\nThey are large animals, and their ability to survive and their aggression surpasses all of their living relatives outside of the Zone.\n
			\nMutagenic processes have played a significant part in shaping these mammals, as they have lost all fur in a few places, and grown long bristly fur in others.\n
			\nUsually if distance is kept and they aren't antagonised, they will stick with their herd of flesh and other boars.\n

			\nIn most cases cats will live alone in a small group of two to three individuals, and will typically dwell in quiet secluded places such as forest thickets.\n
			\nOften when they attack, the first will try to distract their prey whilst the rest sneak behind and try to slash and bite, until the victim tires and/or bleeds out.\n

			\nWith a duplicate set of organs, no central circulatory system, and its whole body permeated with capillaries, the chimera can easily shrug off organ failure and massive blood loss.\n
			\nIts second head allows for an even wider field of view, its hind legs allow it to jump huge distances, and its razor sharp claws and teeth can tear through practically any body armour.\n

			%c[guide_blue]Controllers%c[default] are some of the most dangerous psychic mutants in the Zone.\n
			\n%c[guide_green]Information%c[default]
			\nOutwardly resembling a human being with a disproportionately enlarged head, a controller is capable of influencing and often directly controlling another living being's actions.\n
			\nUnlike other psychic mutants a controller won't manipulate physical objects, but will instead fight with its brain - in a very literal sense - often taking its enemies through surprise and confusion.\n
			\nThe controller attacks mainly with a directed psi-bolt, which causes severe damage to the brain of its recipient, whilst passive exposure to the mutant can ultimately lead to suicide or zombification.\n
			\nIt is widely believed that they can only attack what they can see, so making good use of cover to conceal yourself from its view could make all the difference in the outcome of fighting this creature.\n

			\n%c[guide_green]Information%c[default]
			\nLike many other creatures living in the Zone, domestic pigs underwent serious mutations following the second disaster, affecting genes responsible for their metabolism.\n
			\nThis eventually caused the animal's phenotype to change significantly, their forelimbs have turned into insect-like legs which the flesh uses for digging up roots and tearing down carrion, whilst their bodies have become extremely bloated and fatty.\n
			\nHowever they are mostly harmless, and will generally flee from a stalker if one approaches unless the creature is attacked or cornered and has nowhere else to run.\n

			\nIt is unclear whether or not they are related to burers, but between them they share a great many psychic similarities making it difficult to dismiss as just coincidence.\n
			\nOn the few rare occasions that observations have been made, karliks are seen captivated by certain locations or artefacts, as if they have tasked themselves with their responsibility, proceeding to attack anything that comes too close.\n

			\nPseudodogs are often seen together with blind dogs, though they are much faster, stronger, and more aggressive than their blind relatives. They are also viciously territorial and will not hesitate to attack intruders.\n
