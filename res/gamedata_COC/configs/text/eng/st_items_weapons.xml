		<text>A special military sniper rifle purpose-built for silent, flashless sniping during special operations where early detection of the shooter may be critical. The Vintar BC provides high armour-piercing capability and stopping power, as well as being equipped with an integrated sniper and optical scope. Highly rated by many stalkers despite its small magazine.</text>

		<text>A weapon made for military units on the basis of the silent sniper rifle. The rifle has higher stopping power than the Vintar BC, its predecessor, at the expense of its rate of fire, which allows the shooter to eliminate enemy forces one by one without revealing his position.</text>

		<text>A tailor-made pump-action shotgun which used to belong to Trapper. The hunter's only requirement in respect of his weapon was that it needed to kill predators in one shot. This philosophy was based on the belief that no matter how many people an animal had killed, it was still just an animal, and thus should not suffer.</text>

  <string id="st_wpn_abakan_descr">
		<text>A modern assault rifle developed as a replacement for the ageing AKM 74/2. The main difference is its high speed 2-round burst firing mode, which allows two bullets to be fired at exactly the same spot on a target up to 100 meters away. This significantly increases the likelihood of hitting the target in comparison to the 1 round firing mode, which considerably improves kill potential, stopping power and armour piercing capability.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="st_wpn_ak74_descr">
		<text>This weapon, designed in 1974, signalled the adoption of small calibre and low impulse rounds by Warsaw Pact countries. A descendant of the most popular assault rifle in the world, the AKM-74/2 has an even bigger muzzle brake, resulting in a reduction of what was already manageable recoil. This facilitates better accuracy and groupings, especially when fired in fast single shots or bursts. As before, the rifle is very simple and reliable.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="st_wpn_ak74u_descr">
		<text>Despite being similar to submachine guns in size, weight and tactical purpose, this weapon is classified as an assault rifle due to the fact that its internal mechanism is identical to that of the AKM 74/2. The weapon is notable for its mobility in close quarters and high armour-penetration capacity, while its drawbacks are its short effective range, despite the relatively long bullet range, a tendency to overheat and high ricochet propensity.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="st_wpn_colt1911_descr">
		<text>An improved version of a classic automatic pistol, which passed all the major armed conflicts of the 20th century with flying colours and entered the new millennium with confidence. Produced by dozens if not hundreds of arms manufacturers around the world in both standard and modified configurations. The weapon's only drawback, its mediocre magazine capacity, is largely compensated by the hard-hitting ammo it uses.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="st_wpn_eagle_descr">
		<text>The ultimate hand cannon - bulky, heavy and highly lethal. Developed as a specialized weapon for hunting medium-sized and large game, as well as for shooting competitions involving firing at steel body targets at distances over 50 meters. Its limited use in the Zone can be attributed to its price, size and weight, which are all double those of other pistols.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="st_wpn_fn2000_descr">
		<text>This futuristic-looking weapon with a bullpup layout is actually a mass produced modular system, comprising a rifle & grenade complex with a computerized fire control system and a 40-mm grenade launcher. Despite its bulky appearance, the weapon is highly ergonomic, easy to use and benefits from good technical characteristics.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="st_wpn_fort_descr">
		<text>A Ukrainian-made pistol predominantly used by law enforcement organisations. Provides higher accuracy, better ergonomics and has a larger magazine than the PMm.  These pistols make it into the Zone in large numbers thanks to the sale of defective weapons, which suffer from technical miscalculations in early design models. Despite this, the pistol is in demand among stalkers thanks to its good combat characteristics.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="st_wpn_g36_descr">
		<text>A new addition to the Western-made assault rifle family, which differs significantly from previous models in the series built on an automatic foundation with a semi-open bolt assembly, this weapon is more like American automatic gas-operated assault rifles with a short-stroke gas piston system. These changes ensure that the rifle is a first-rate example of a modern weapon - lightweight, reliable and ergonomic.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="st_wpn_l85_descr">
		<text>This rifle's considerable number of drawbacks caused most of these weapons to be modernized, with the retired stock making its way to the Zone via the black market. The rifle's main advantages are its built-in 4x scope, high single-shot accuracy and reliable upgrade technology. When the weapon is fired in bursts, its accuracy decreases significantly and the rifle's basic internal mechanisms become somewhat unreliable.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="st_wpn_lr300_descr">
		<text>A new step in the development of this famous weapon family. The changes were made to the upper half of the steel construction comprising the barrel, gas tube and bolt assembly, reducing the weapon's weight, improving ergonomics and its gas system. The weapon is highly accurate, although its propensity to catch dirt makes it a poor choice for the Zone's difficult conditions.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="st_wpn_pb_descr">
		<text>This pistol was developed in the second half of the 20th century on the basis of the PMm for use by special forces and scouting units. The front of the pistol's barrel is covered with an integrated silencer, while the bolt mechanism is short, which prevents a back-moving spring from being located inside it, and it is therefore situated in the weapon's handle. Morally obsolete, the weapon is still effective in the right hands.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="st_wpn_pm_descr">
		<text>This Soviet legacy is the most common pistol in the Zone and is one of the best compact self-defence handguns available. It is small, highly reliable, easy to use and maintain in working order. It also suffers from several drawbacks, including its short range, low firing accuracy and poor stopping power, while also losing out to modern pistols in its class in terms of weight and magazine size.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="st_wpn_protecta_descr">
		<text>A smoothbore combat revolver-type shotgun intended to provide extreme firepower for militarized units. The weapon benefits from a large magazine and a high effective rate of fire, but its bulkiness and considerable weight, combined with a long reload time, are the price to be paid for these advantages. Rare in the Zone and is used primarily to clear closed spaces of mutants.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="st_wpn_rpg7_descr">
		<text>This grenade launcher from the 1960s made its way into the Zone from army depots. The weapon is a smoothbore single-shot recoilless launch system with an open-rear tube. Comes with a PGO-7 x2.7 optical scope. Although its huge size and weight make it an unlikely choice for stalkers, given its huge destructive power and ease of use, it has found admirers in the Zone.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="st_wpn_sig220_descr">
		<text>The only remaining mass produced model of a globally renowned pistol, this weapon has earned a reputation for its excellent ergonomics and accuracy, and while its magazine is relatively small, it benefits from powerful ammo and a mechanism that functions like a Swiss watch. Some believe the SIP-t M200 to be the best mass produced .45ACP calibre handgun there is and it has certainly got a following among experienced stalkers and mercenaries.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="st_wpn_spas12_descr">
		<text>This special purpose smoothbore automatic shotgun was designed in the second half of the 20th century and comes with pump-action and self-cocking firing modes. Used as an all-purpose weapon by the police and assault troops. Notable for its reliability and tactical flexibility. Despite its large weight, complex mechanism and considerable cost it is in demand in the Zone due to its effectiveness against mutants.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="st_wpn_svu_descr">
		<text>A modernized version of the SVDm-2 sniper rifle in a compact bullpup design made on the order of rapid response forces. It allows faster precision fire and is considerably lighter, while its single shot firing accuracy at short and medium range is similar to that of its predecessor. These qualities have earned it the admiration of countless stalkers.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="st_wpn_val_descr">
		<text>A modified version of the silent Vintar BC sniper rifle, this assault rifle was designed as a special forces weapon. The rifle's primary purpose is effective fire against enemies employing modern personal protection equipment without disclosing the shooter's location. Thanks to its integrated silencer and 9x39 calibre round with a heavy subsonic bullet, the weapon's noise and muzzle flash have been reduced to a minimum.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="st_wpn_gauss_descr">
		<text>A super-accurate hi-tech weapon known as item 62, this rifle was developed in secret laboratories located inside the Zone. The weapon operates by accelerating bullets to extremely high speeds using a system of electromagnets, which provides incredible stopping power with virtually no recoil.  The weapon is powered by using encapsulated artefact fragments in the batteries.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="st_wpn_beretta_descr">
		<text>Martha pistols enjoy the reputation of a relatively reliable, albeit somewhat cumbersome weapon, around the world. In service with armed forces and police across the ocean, as well as various military and law enforcement organisations worldwide.  The pistol is equally popular with members of the underworld, thanks to its powerful round and magazine capacity. Marthas found in the Zone are usually dated, probably from retired stock.</text>
  </string>
  <string id="st_wpn_walther_descr">
		<text>An excellent Western pistol known for its reliability, high capacity magazine and good accuracy, as well as being among the most ergonomic handguns in its class. One of the most widely used pistols in the Zone, both among professionals and rookies who can afford it.</text>
