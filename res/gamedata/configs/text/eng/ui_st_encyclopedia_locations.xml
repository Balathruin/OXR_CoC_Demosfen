			\nIt was here on April 26th, 1986 that the first disaster occurred, after reactor 4 exploded following a power surge and failed emergency shutdown, vast plumes of radioactive materials were launched into the atmosphere.\n
			\nWithin a radius of 30 kilometers from the station a total evacuation of the population was carried out and an exclusion zone was formed - separating everything within from the rest of the world by way of a protected perimeter.\n
			\nThough extremely deep within Monolith territory, stalkers have attempted to reach this site for years - believing that within can be found a device with the power to grant one their most heartfelt desires.\n

			\nDuring clean-up operations following the initial disaster, much heavy machinery was operated in the vicinity of the reactor, and was primarily used to remove highly radioactive materials.\n

			\nIn the years following the creation of the Zone as we know it today, the area has become plagued by conflict as Duty and Freedom fight over territory, all the while soldiers and bandits encroach from the east and south.\n
			\nDespite being so isolated and difficult to get to, many stalkers have noticed the vehicles here are gradually being stripped bare - with many believing that somebody, perhaps the military, is attempting to salvage the metals and illegally sell them for scrap.\n
