		<text>"Just some notes about old men's conspiracy theories". \nThere are rumours that the Agroprom Institute was used as a front for an unofficial lab in the years preceding the 2006 year accident. This lab hosted a number of very unusual experiments. The traders have dug up a lot of information about these laboratories. I met with the Barkeep, he says he sent Duty scouts to get into the underground vaults of Dark Valley, called X-18, but they disappeared. There are another rumours regarding a "Psi-Brain" mechanism. The whole neighbourhood in Yantar is under the influence of that piece of trash - it zombified everyone who came within range. There is another mechanism in Red Forest radar underground, called Lab X-19, and that's what is likely to be the Brain Scorcher. There is evidence to suggest that the presence of the Brain Scorcher intentionally blocks the road to the North, but no one knows exactly what it is. The Barkeep believes that the Brain Scorcher is man-made, and these mechanisms are not always operating at full strength. He thinks there are periods when their power is lowered to cool down the apparatus. It's time to visit all the underground laboratories in the Zone and find out what kind of secrets they are hiding. Too bad, that I'm too old for this shit. I wish Strelok would be still around, but damn, he disappeared years ago.</text>

		<text>The manuscript contains a short report on how Fang and Strelok infiltrated a hidden laboratory and their journey there. It makes mention of large Monolith presence in and around the Chernobyl NPP. More specifically under the concrete sarcophagus, also suggesting it may be their base of operations but with the intent to hide something. Reading further it states that they discovered laboratory hidden further in the north under the generators, however they were unable to gain access at the time of writing as they required the use of a decoder.</text>
